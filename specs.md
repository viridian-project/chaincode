Viridian chaincode specifications
=================================

This file defines the behavior of the chaincode API, i.e. the functions that can be used to interact with the blockchain. It is meant for TDD (test-driven development) and BDD (behavioral-driven development) purposes.

What functionality must the functions provide? What is supposed to happen when a function is given a certain input? What kinds of wrong usage can there be and how is the code supposed to handle it?

Based on the specifications in this file, tests can be written that will ensure that the code is behaving properly.

This file is about the code. See `model` and `output` for the data model that the code operates on.
